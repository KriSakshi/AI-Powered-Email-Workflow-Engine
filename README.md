📧 AI-Powered Email Workflow Engine

An intelligent email workflow built with Python and Azure OpenAI that reads incoming messages, classifies their intent, and automatically sends appropriate responses or quotations.

🧾 Overview

This system automates client-email handling for Aura’s support and quotation inboxes.
It connects to a mailbox, detects whether an email is a Support request, a Quote request, or Other, and then performs the correct action:

Support requests → send a polite acknowledgment.

Quote requests → extract required data, simulate quote creation, generate a PDF, and reply with the document.

Other messages → safely log and ignore.

All actions are stored in a local SQLite database for auditing.



⚙️ Setup
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure environment variables

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in:

EMAIL_USER=<your_email>
EMAIL_PASS=<app_password>
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<endpoint>
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=<api_key>
AZURE_DEPLOYMENT=<deployment_name>
AZURE_API_VERSION=<api_version>

4. Run
./run.sh or python app/main.py

🔑 Environment Variables
Key	Description
EMAIL_USER	IMAP/SMTP email ID
EMAIL_PASS	App password
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT	Azure OpenAI endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY	Azure API key
AZURE_DEPLOYMENT	Model deployment name
AZURE_API_VERSION	API version string


🔁 Workflow

imap_reader.py connects to Gmail IMAP, fetches unseen messages from approved senders, and saves attachments.

classifier.py calls the Azure OpenAI endpoint to label each email as Support, Quote, or Other (with a keyword fallback).

support_agent.py checks if it’s a valid issue and sends a ready-made acknowledgment.

quote_agent.py extracts or requests missing details, simulates quote creation through aura_client.py, generates a PDF via pdf_generator.py, and emails it back.

smtp_sender.py handles sending replies with or without attachments.

db.py logs every processed email (sender, subject, label, action) in a local SQLite database.

The workflow runs once per call of main.py and then exits.
